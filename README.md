# Laravel Dev Enviroment For Repl.it

Hello There and Welcome to a small side-project of mine! This is just quick project I made because I was bored and this will be updated in-freqently. 

Simply put this is a development setup if you want to experiement with Laravel on Repl.it, this one alreday comes with chriper (The project from the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com)) pre-setup and ready to go but feel free to take that down and use it however you wish to, just make sure to replace the chirper directory on the run command with the new directory of your new project. (Can be found in .replit)

### IMPORTANT:
As this is running on replit and being sent to you over the interwebs, your browser will consider anything running via the npm dev enviroment insecure. So makes sure to be careful when you're experimenting and yes as a result this means that usually CSS will not load :[

Anyways, I'll probably make a useful update in a few days/weeks time but in the meantime, enjoy! More guideance on how to configure this is in repl.md.
